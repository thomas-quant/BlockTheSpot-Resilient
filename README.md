## Overview

BlockTheSpot focuses on the Windows desktop client and keeps the patch surface small:

- blocks ad-related requests
- applies signature-based SPA patches through `config.ini`
- enables Spotify's hidden developer menu

This project is for the standard [Spotify desktop app](https://www.spotify.com/download/windows/) only. It does not support the Microsoft Store build.

## Requirements

- Windows 64-bit
- Spotify desktop client installed in `%APPDATA%\Spotify`
- Spotify fully closed before install, update, or uninstall

## Fresh install

1. Open `%APPDATA%\Spotify`.
2. Rename the original `chrome_elf.dll` to `chrome_elf_required.dll`.
3. Download the latest release assets: `chrome_elf.dll`, `blockthespot.dll`, and `config.ini`.
4. Copy those files into `%APPDATA%\Spotify`.
5. Start Spotify.

## Update after Spotify updates

1. Close Spotify completely.
2. Open `%APPDATA%\Spotify`.
3. Remove the custom `chrome_elf.dll`, `blockthespot.dll`, and `config.ini`.
4. If Spotify restored its stock `chrome_elf.dll`, rename it to `chrome_elf_required.dll`.
5. Download the latest release assets again.
6. Copy `chrome_elf.dll`, `blockthespot.dll`, and `config.ini` into `%APPDATA%\Spotify`.
7. Start Spotify.

## Uninstall

1. Close Spotify.
2. Remove `chrome_elf.dll`, `blockthespot.dll`, and `config.ini` from `%APPDATA%\Spotify`.
3. Rename `chrome_elf_required.dll` back to `chrome_elf.dll`.
4. Start Spotify again, or reinstall Spotify if you want a completely clean state.

## Experimental developer features

2. Click the two dots in the top-left corner.
3. Go to `Develop > Show debug window`.
4. Toggle experimental options there as needed.
